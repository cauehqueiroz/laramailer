A simple Contact page built with Laravel <3,

  

# Running

  

The code is ready to run in a docker container, on the fly! ðŸ˜ƒ

  

1- Clone (or extract) this repository somewhere.

  

2- Open up a terminal in the cloned/extracted folder.

  

3- Update the dependencies with composer, run this command (if you have composer installed):

`$ composer install`

  

4- Migrate the database using laravel artisan (with the proper URL to the database in the `.env` file):

`php artisan migrate`

  

(from here on it is optional, do it only if you want to use the docker container to run)

  

Note: If you are going to run this on the docker container please change the database host to: `DB_HOST=database` remember to change **AFTER** running the previous command (if your PHP is on your ENV PATH),

  

4- Run the following in your terminal (if you have docker installed):

`$ docker-compose up --build`

  

If no errors are shown in your terminal, and when the **webserver** and the **database** are running open a page at `http:\\localhost:8080`.
